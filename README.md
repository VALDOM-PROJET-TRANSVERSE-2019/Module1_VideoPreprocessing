# The big picture
This repository is part of the ‘projet transverse’ of the [Advanced Master ValDom](http://www.enseeiht.fr/fr/formation/masteres-specialises/valorisation-des-donnees-massives.html) which is co-accredited by INP-ENSEEIHT and INSA Toulouse.

This year (2019/2020) the goal of the project is to develop a video analysis service. The main functionality is the recognition and tracking of vehicles in order to be able to estimate the emission rate (Co2) produced by traffic in the areas concerned.

# Module1_VideoPreprocessing
The function of the video preprocessing module is to extract a set of images from a video of road traffic and to process them in order to obtain an uniform format that allows them to be processed more efficiently afterwards.
